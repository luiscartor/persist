<b>Persist Package</b>

An R package to implement the Colony Site Persistence Index (Carrasco and Toquenaga, in preparation).

The Colony Site Persistence Index estimates the site fidelity levels of animal populations at colony level. It also implements mean nearest neighbor distance calculations for a set of xy coordinates.
